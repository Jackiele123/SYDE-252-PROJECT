% Define the forward kinematics equations for your specific robotic arm
% In this example, let's assume simple trigonometric relationships:
% x = L1 * cos(θ1) + L2 * cos(θ1 + θ2)
% y = L1 * sin(θ1) + L2 * sin(θ1 + θ2)

% Define target end-effector position
x_target = 3; % Desired x-coordinate
y_target = 2; % Desired y-coordinate

% Initial guess for joint angles (you can start with any reasonable values)
theta1_guess = 0;
theta2_guess = 0;

% Set a tolerance for convergence
tolerance = 1e-6;

% Maximum number of iterations (to prevent infinite loops)
max_iterations = 100;

% Loop to iteratively refine joint angles
for iteration = 1:max_iterations
    % Calculate the current end-effector position using the current joint angles
    x_current = L1 * cos(theta1_guess) + L2 * cos(theta1_guess + theta2_guess);
    y_current = L1 * sin(theta1_guess) + L2 * sin(theta1_guess + theta2_guess);
    
    % Compute the error between the current position and the target position
    error_x = x_target - x_current;
    error_y = y_target - y_current;
    
    % Check if the error is small enough to stop the iteration
    if norm([error_x; error_y]) < tolerance
        disp('Converged to desired position');
        break;
    end
    
    % Compute the Jacobian matrix
    J = [-L1 * sin(theta1_guess) - L2 * sin(theta1_guess + theta2_guess), -L2 * sin(theta1_guess + theta2_guess);
         L1 * cos(theta1_guess) + L2 * cos(theta1_guess + theta2_guess), L2 * cos(theta1_guess + theta2_guess)];
    
    % Calculate the change in joint angles using the Newton-Raphson method
    delta_theta = J \ [error_x; error_y];
    
    % Update the joint angles
    theta1_guess = theta1_guess + delta_theta(1);
    theta2_guess = theta2_guess + delta_theta(2);
end

% Display the final joint angles
